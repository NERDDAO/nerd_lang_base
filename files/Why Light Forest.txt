We are living in a moment of significant uncertainty, churn, and violence.
The geopolitical order is collapsing, driving a new vicious cycle of nationalism and conflict tragically playing out in front of our eyes. Our planet’s ecology is completely off balance threatening the very conditions for life for all beings. Digital technologies are transforming our societies and lives in ways we struggle to truly grasp. The governments and mainstream institutions of our time seem increasingly inhumane and unable to deliver for us.

At an individual level it feels like we are grasping for a compass to faithfully navigate ourselves in search of love, security, freedom, and joy. While our lives are more digitally connected and full information than ever, the overwhelming reality is disconnection—from our environment, people, but most critically, to our own sense of humanity. Our attention is hacked to train AI models, sell advertising, and be a subject to emotional and information warfare. The stories we were told about life no longer resonate or square up with our lived reality. Depression, doom scrolling, Neijuan内卷, loneliness pandemic…the litany of symptoms to describe our feeling of malaise continues to grow.
It begs the questions: does the crises of our time stem from the very systems and institutions entrusted to find the answers?  In other words, are we dealing with root-level system failure?
Our political, medical, food, finance, security, education, media, business, etc. systems are all centered on infinite extraction and consumption, fear, and violence. It would appear that our systems are fundamentally misaligned with the ecology of our planet and fail to recognize the interconnected nature that illuminates humans and all beings. As Healer and Physician Gabor Mate puts it, "we are living in a toxic culture that we have come to consider ‘normal’". We are applying a cast to the arm when the whole body is in a coma. The longer we continue in this present paradigm our entire ecology and culture takes us closer to the brink. So how do we even begin to approach this predicament?
A journey of regeneration of our planet begins at home.
A personal journey of healing and self (re-)discovery. To begin to imagine regeneration there needs to be recognition that we are products of these flawed systems and institutions we seek to change. Our minds, belief systems, values, concepts of self and humanity, are conditioned to accept the status quo paradigm as normal. Each of us hold inside our bodies trauma of growing up in this toxic culture that drives us in unseen ways. It is difficult to heal the planet when our own internal worlds are stormy and in conflict. Without this journey we risk recreating the old in new forms. A paradigm shift in the world must come out of an evolution in our own minds—how we perceive our true nature and relationship with the world.
In bringing awareness to own minds and belief systems we may be able to start to see ourselves and the world afresh. Through looking at beliefs about who we are, why we seek, and what will bring us true fulfillment we may begin to see that we hold many beliefs that we never chose or that don't serve our higher good. This has been my experience, and i'll share more in time.
Through unlearning we may renew our own understanding of what it means to be human and the energy we share with all beings. As many spiritual teachers from across walks have said, our outer world is a reflection of our inner reality. Shift the inner reality and our world begins to change.  J. Krishnamurti speaks poignantly:
"When the mind is free from all conditioning, then you will find that there comes the creativity of reality...and it is only such a mind, a mind which is constantly experiencing this creativity, that can bring about a different outlook, different values, a different world"
We may start to unlock a new potential when we center around new values such as human scale & inner purpose; joy and creativity; presence/present; openness & freedom; distributed/decentralised governance. We can start to lay the building blocks for Ecological Civilization which creates the conditions for life to thrive. We may start to purpose technology to bring us closer and in a more harmonious relationship way nature.  Rather than turning our energy to dismantle or destroy, we may purpose this energy for ourselves. To make shifts in our own lives. To power new ideas and creations that can create a world in our new fresh image. Through this personal and collective shift we start to deny the energy that drives the systems of our world today. Ivan Illych writes:
neither ideological criticism nor social action can bring about a new society. Only disenchantment with and detachment from the central social ritual and reform of that ritual can bring about radical change. 
In this moment we are presented with a choice.
To continue on our existing path which we know to be unsustainable, failing to deliver for us. Or to turn to a path of healing and put our energy behind regeneration.
Light Forest will be a space where we can have these journeys together.

What I do envision for Light Forest?
	•	It will be a space for inner journeys of healing and self-inquiry. We may learn together on how to to live more authentically, renegotiate our relationship with digital spaces, cultivate an open mind to see the world afresh, and harness our inner creativity.
	•	It will also be a space where we explore everything from ancient spiritual philosophies such as such as Daoism, Buddhism, Zen, Advaita, and wisdom centers around the world, to newer healing practises and techniques.
	•	We'll explore as many models, frameworks, histories, knowledge systems, technologies, projects, etc. that can help us developing our thinking about regeneration of our planet that gets to the root of our planetary.
Let us explore with open minds and hearts. 🙏🏼
