What is ‘Pagoda’?
An Introduction to Pagoda
Pagoda starts as a humble assemblage of Asian web3/Ethereum ecosystem builders, thinkers and leaders. We aspire to be a resilient and interoperable support network that provides change-makers in political, economic, technological, and spiritual sectors with an alternative lifestyle and career path focused on humanitarian care across Asia.
We’re cultivating high trust relationships through peer support & mutual care, so that people grow & develop, to be better equipped for doing meaningful work in the world.
In other words, people who spend time in Pagoda tend to develop a sense of belonging, grow more emotional maturity, develop skills & confidence, and find new opportunities to make a beneficial contribution to the world. Our approach puts people before projects. Trust is our priority, and we’re gradually aligning our livelihood with our values.
The first Pagoda gathering was held under this vision statement : "we gather to weave the diverse threads of Asia's cultures and philosophies into a united tapestry of Ethereum aiming to shape a decentralized world that honors our shared heritage and distinct voices. "
Three key elements of Pagoda
**Pagodians -** People of Pagoda, Those who are officially accepted to the network
Nodes - Communities founded or initiated by Pagodians.
Pods - Working groups within Pagoda, moving us forward.

Key Activities
Self-Organizing
Pagoda is designed to be a self-organizing system, meaning initiatives can emerge from anywhere, there is no central plan. If you have an idea, share it with others, find collaborators, and develop it together. For this to work, you need to know people! The main ways we do this are through Connection Calls, Pods & Gatherings.
Connection Calls
This is a space for people to connect with each other, discuss specific topics, run group processes, etc. The connection calls have a simple framework: Check-in, Main topic, Check-out. Anyone can host. If no-one has offered to host a Connection Call the people present in the call decide after the check-in what they want to use the time for.
Our experience is that the calls are always very valuable and can vary from deep sharing or supporting someone going through a difficult time to a fun playful time in a self development game. Every so often the Connection Call is Pagoda focused.
Non-members can be invited to join the connection calls after a request to one of the Pod members. The host of the specific call can then decide whether a guest will work or not.
Pods
A pod is a small group who meet periodically over a defined length of time (e.g. 3-5 people who meet weekly for 2 months). This is one of the most reliable ways to get to know people in the network, get support, and find new collaborations.
We open a new pod-formation round after each gathering. (You can also self-organize pods at any time.)
More about Pods in the Pagoda Handbook.
Gatherings
So far we’ve had a rhythm of 2x multi-day retreats per year. At the most recent gathering there was a suggestion that we could host more frequent gatherings in different parts of the region. Ideally we’d have multiple local bases we keep returning to.
Gatherings are the way we grow the number of people in the Network, which increases the potential collaborations. We encourage a minimum of 20% newcomers at gatherings so we keep growing, and we suggest a max of 40% so the culture is not too diluted.
Gatherings help to synchronize our collective attention, so this is a good time to address governance questions & make decisions together. We could for example elect new Representatives at a Gathering.
Any Network Member can host a gathering, if they co-host with someone who has done it before.
Pods Agreement
A Pod Agreement is a framework for creating and managing small, focused groups within a larger network. The agreement provides guidance on operational aspects and emphasizes continuous improvement through reflection and shared learning. This structure enables groups to form around common interests, work towards specific goals, and contribute to the broader community's growth.
Nodes Agreement
A Nodes Agreement outlines the framework for partner organizations or groups to collaborate within the network while sharing Pagoda's values. It defines the types of nodes (physical, community, or pop-up), their formation requirements, and how they can utilize Pagoda's Circular Layer infrastructure for resources and opportunities. The agreement establishes guidelines for node operations, inter-node collaborations, and contributions to the broader Pagoda community, ensuring a flexible yet cohesive network of diverse, semi-autonomous groups working towards shared goals.
What is Nodes?
Nodes in the Pagoda ecosystem are partner organizations or groups that share Pagoda's value system and collaborate within the network. They can be location-based, mission-based, or event-based (pop-up) communities. Nodes act as extensions of Pagoda, spreading its values and mission while maintaining their own unique identity and focus. They benefit from Pagoda's Circular Layer infrastructure, which provides access to talents, events, resources, workshops, and other opportunities. A node can be formed by as few as two Pagodians, making it a flexible and accessible way to expand the Pagoda community.
	•	**Location-based nodes (**Something like 4seas or Nonce)
	•	**Mission-based nodes (**Something like da0, code for japan)
	•	**Event-based nodes (pop-up nodes) (**Something like muchiangmai, zulandia, Xbound)

Catalyst Agreement
In chemistry, a Catalyst is an agent of change, used in small amounts relative to the reactants, which reduces the amount of energy required to create a reaction, and activates the rest of the system without itself getting consumed.
With Catalysts at Pagoda, we are attempting to take the function of decentralized leadership, share it across multiple agents, and cycle many people through the role under a set time limit. The goal is to maintain a rhythm of evolution at Pagoda by inviting contribution, participation, and action, whilst reducing the friction people encounter trying to make changes and improvements.
Role & Responsibilities
As leaders, Catalysts are responsible for defining and managing their own work. The specific functions below are intended to only occupy a small fraction of a Catalyst's committed time, with the rest spent on their self-directed work program.
	•	Support Pods and Make Their Work Easier The primary responsibility of Catalysts is to catalyze pods and help them be more productive. This can involve activities like strategy setting, co-facilitation, conflict resolution, fund raising and recruitment. Catalysts exist to support the work, not do the work.
	•	Interface Between Pods and the Network Catalysts are a focal point in the attention economy. They are responsible for maintaining a list of active working groups and ensuring their activities are communicated succinctly to the wider network. They are also responsible for supporting people who wish to join working groups and find somewhere to contribute.
	•	Maintain a Prioritized Network Improvements List : Pagoda Tasks is the catalyst's responsibility. They are responsible for keeping it up to date and ensuring that working groups activity is clearly represented and that ideas for new improvements are frequently reviewed and considered.
	•	Hold Pod Rhythms Catalysts are responsible for facilitating key rhythms and decisions for the ecosystem of pods as a whole.

Conflict Resolution
At Pagoda we want to do conflict well. We want tensions between members to be generative, healthy and productive. We want a culture of robust debate, honesty, and care - all in service of our mission & value. In this document you will find the principles, practice and process to take to safely and appropriately resolve conflict.
Note : If you've contemplated the experience and have decided it feels like it may be harassment or abuse, please consult our Harassment and Abuse Policy.
Principles
	•	Resolve conflicts as close as possible to the people involved. Begin with the people directly involved, and escalate from there as needed.
	•	We have mutual responsibility and care for each other. We act in good faith and work to be constructive, empathetic, and honest. We resolve conflicts with both our individual needs and the needs of the network in mind.
	•	When disagreement becomes conflicted and is blocking progress, is hurtful or harmful, a resolution needs to be found. We engage to the best of our ability to resolve conflict, and seek help when needed.
	•	Anyone affected by a conflict can escalate an issue that is not being resolved at the current level of engagement.
	•	Resolution means the parties involved feel heard, the agreed outcome or change is clear, and normal decision-making and activity within Pagoda is possible. If a conflict continues to negatively impact an individual or the team, it is not resolved.
Stewarding
At Pagoda, we operate without traditional hierarchical roles, so we've developed alternative methods to fulfill essential functions. While some responsibilities are managed through Catalyst or other processes, stewarding is our unique approach to peer support.
Role & Responsibilities of Stewards
In other organizations, certain tasks might be handled by supervisors, but at Pagoda, these are managed by stewards:
	•	Conflict Resolution: Addressing issues when a peer is being difficult.
	•	Personal Development: Supporting your personal and professional growth.
	•	Accountability: Ensuring you follow through on your commitments.
	•	Human Connection: Providing a relatable point of contact for discussing matters with 'the organism'.
The Role of a Steward
When you face an issue, you need a specific, trustworthy person to turn to – that's your steward. They may not solve every problem directly, but they are your main contact to ensure issues are resolved. If you're unsure whom to approach, your steward is always a reliable option.
Stewarding focuses not on managing daily tasks but on supporting you as an individual and your relationship with Pagoda. Stewards can act as mentors, guides, or sounding boards. In conflict situations, they ensure you are well-supported and help facilitate resolutions.
Stewarding for Newcomers
Stewarding also plays a crucial role in our onboarding process for newcomers. Each new member is paired with a steward, providing a friendly and knowledgeable point of contact from the start. This relationship helps newcomers navigate the organization, understand our culture, and integrate smoothly into their roles. It ensures they feel supported, connected, and equipped to contribute effectively from day one.
The Impact of Stewarding
Every member of Pagoda has a steward. These relationships create connections across the organization, foster opportunities for sharing insights, and promote a deeper understanding of individuals and their work areas. Ultimately, stewards help us take care of each other, ensuring everyone's well-being and facilitating a welcoming environment for all.
